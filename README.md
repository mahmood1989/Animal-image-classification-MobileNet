# Animal image classification by using MobileNet
In this Jupyter notebook I applied transfer learning to develop a model for classification of images of 50 different animals. The source of images is Kaggle and I used MobileNet model for training my model.
There are 151 animal types in the original dataset from Kaggle. I just used the first 50 animal types (sorted by name) for training my model.
